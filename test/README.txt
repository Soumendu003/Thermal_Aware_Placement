This directory contains processing codes for each individual benchmark family.

Since the raw benchmark files we will get may be diffenet from each other, we need to pre-process them before we can plug in our main placement codes.

This directory will contains entry point codes for each test cases. These will also help users to understand how to set up their own benchmark files, before calling placement routines.
